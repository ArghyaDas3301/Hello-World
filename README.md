# Hello-World
Introduction to Github
Hello Everyone,
My name is Arghya but people just call me Ar because that's so much easier to pronounce.
I've never used Github or Python before so i am really excited to get started on this class.
Machine learning has always fascinated me and captivated my imagination so i am looking forward to learning a lot from this class.
